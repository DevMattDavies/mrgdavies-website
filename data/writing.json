    "text": "<p>Outback, Michael’s debut novel published in May 2023 by HarperCollins, is the culmination of years of fiction-writing. It features the protagonist Bill Kemp – described by Jeffrey Deaver as ‘part James Bond, part Philip Marlowe, and all hero’ – who first appeared in the Desmond Bagley thriller Domino Island, which Michael was commissioned to complete for posthumous publication in 2019. Outback is a kind of sequel and honours the legacy of the ‘master of the genre’ Bagley in the centenary year of his birth.<br />Elsewhere, Michael contributed to Vicious Circle, a collaboration between a dozen writers to create a novel in just one weekend. His short stories have won awards and the latest, Last Tram to Fleetwood, is published in an anthology entitled Lancashire Stories.</p>"
